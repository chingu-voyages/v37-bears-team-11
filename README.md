#  Food Truck App **(To Update)**


A free-to-use application that consists of an order management system and location sharing between food services and their customers.

## Introduction:

Food services are not always able to setup easily with an order management system due reasons such as costs or non-established locations (eg. food trucks). This app will fill the gap for those requirements for those necessary businesses.
